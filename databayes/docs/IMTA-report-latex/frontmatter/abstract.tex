% the abstract

EdgeMind is a young innovative company which operates in the field of industrial risk analysis and operational safety, and offers its expertise in the implementation of predictive maintenance strategies. EdgeMind has thus made use of its knowledge of the sector and its scientific expertise to support manufacturers in their risk prevention approach and improve the sustainability of their systems, by offering them tailor-made solutions based on advanced techniques of data processing, machine learning, probabilistic modeling and data visualization.

In 2018, the french company RATP requested EdgeMind to develop a maintenance recommendation application. Thus EdgeMind started up to develop a complete generic machine learning framework specifically for diagnostic/prognostic field. The processing chain is composed of four parts. First of all, the datas have to be prepared, cleaned and filtered. Then the framework let the user choose the machine learning model in order to fit from the existing datas and then, by inference calculus, find predictions from new datas. The next part is the performance evaluation module to compare the different algorithms developed. And the last part is the creation of a dashboard, i.e. interactive educational visualizations to facilitate the interpretation of fault diagnosis results.
