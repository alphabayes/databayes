	abstract = {We present several techniques for knowledge engineering of large belief networks (BNs) based on the our experiences with a network derived from a large medical knowledge base. The noisy-MAX, a generalization of the noisy-OR gate, is used to model causal independence in a BN with multivalued variables. We describe the use of leak probabilities to enforce the closed-world assumption in our model. We present Netview, a visualization tool based on causal independence and the use of leak probabilities. The Netview software allows knowledge engineers to dynamically view subnetworks for knowledge engineering, and it provides version control for editing a BN. Netview generates sub-networks in which leak probabilities are dynamically updated to reflect the missing portions of the network.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic inference algorithms for belief updating, finding the most probable explanation, the maximum a posteriori hypothesis, and the maximum expected utility are reformulated within the bucket elimination framework. This emphasizes the principles common to many of the algorithms appearing in the probabilistic inference literature and clarifies the relationship of such algorithms to nonserial dynamic programming algorithms. A general method for combining conditioning and bucket elimination is also presented. For all the algorithms, bounds on complexity are given as a function of the problemâ€™s structure.},

	title = {Bayesian {Networks} and {Decision} {Graphs}},
	isbn = {978-0-387-68282-2},
	abstract = {Probabilistic graphical models and decision graphs are powerful modeling tools for reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. As modeling languages they allow a natural specification of problem domains with inherent uncertainty, and from a computational perspective they support efficient algorithms for automatic construction and query answering. This includes belief updating, finding the most probable explanation for the observed evidence, detecting conflicts in the evidence entered into the network, determining optimal strategies, analyzing for relevance, and performing sensitivity analysis. The book introduces probabilistic graphical models and decision graphs, including Bayesian networks and influence diagrams. The reader is introduced to the two types of frameworks through examples and exercises, which also instruct the reader on how to build these models.  The book is a new edition of Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs by Finn V. Jensen. The new edition is structured into two parts. The first part focuses on probabilistic graphical models. Compared with the previous book, the new edition also includes a thorough description of recent extensions to the Bayesian network modeling language, advances in exact and approximate belief updating algorithms, and methods for learning both the structure and the parameters of a Bayesian network. The second part deals with decision graphs, and in addition to the frameworks described in the previous edition, it also introduces Markov decision processes and partially ordered decision problems. The authors also      provide a well-founded practical introduction to Bayesian networks, object-oriented Bayesian networks, decision trees, influence diagrams (and variants hereof), and Markov decision processes.   give practical advice on the construction of Bayesian networks, decision trees, and influence diagrams from domain knowledge.  give several examples and exercises exploiting computer systems for dealing with Bayesian networks and decision graphs.   present a thorough introduction to state-of-the-art solution and analysis algorithms.   The book is intended as a textbook, but it can also be used for self-study and as a reference book.},
