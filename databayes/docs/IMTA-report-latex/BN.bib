	abstract = {Given key performance indicators collected with ﬁne granularity as time series, our aim is to predict and explain failures in storage environments. Although explainable predictive modeling based on spiky telemetry data is key in many domains, current approaches cannot tackle this problem. Deep learning methods suitable for sequence modeling and learning temporal dependencies, such as RNNs, are effective, but opaque from an explainability perspective. Our approach ﬁrst extracts the anomalous spikes from time series as events and then builds an RNN classiﬁer with attention mechanisms to embed the irregularity and frequency of these events. A preliminary evaluation on real world storage environments shows that our approach can predict failures within a 3-day prediction window with comparable accuracy as traditional RNN-based classiﬁers. At the same time it can explain the predictions by returning the key anomalous events which led to those failure predictions.},

The investigation of the human diagnostic reasoning process has resulted in the abstraction and capturing of the human ability to learn, understand, and diagnose different machinery belonging to a particular class. The captured abstraction of human diagnostic expertise have been integrated with the expert system development expertise of knowledge engineers to provide a customized expert system shell for developing machine fault diagnosis expert systems. The designed machine fault diagnosis shell reduces the development time, effort and skill making use of generalized modules for knowledge acquisition, knowledge verification, application system generation, learning, explanation, and eliminates the burden of designing and developing each application diagnosis expert system separately. The developed shell has been validated by generating a prototype fault diagnosis expert system for a Cincinnati Milacron 786 robot.},

One of the issues in vehicle fault diagnosis is the difficulty of successful interpretation of failure symptoms to correctly diagnose the real root cause. This paper presents an innovative Bayesian Network based method for guiding off-line vehicle fault diagnosis. By using a vehicle infotainment system as a case study, a number of Bayesian diagnostic models have been established for fault cases with single and multiple symptoms. Particular considerations are given to the design of the Bayesian model structure, determination of prior probabilities of root causes, and diagnostic procedure. In order to unburden the computation, an object oriented model structure has been adopted to prevent the model from overly large. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of guiding vehicle diagnostics in a probabilistic manner. Furthermore, the method features a multiple-symptoms-orientated troubleshooting strategy, and is capable of diagnosing multiple symptoms optimally and simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Fault diagnosis is an area of great concern of any industry to reduce maintenance cost and increase profitability in the mean time. But most of the researches tend to rely on sensor data and equipment structure, which are expensive because each category of equipment differs from the others. Thus developing a universal system remains a key challenge to be solved. A universal expert system is developed in this paper making full use of expertspsila knowledge to diagnose the possible root causes and the corresponding probabilities for maintenance decision making support. Bayesian network was chosen as the inference engine of the system through raw data analysis. Improved causal relationship questionnaire and probability scale method were applied to construct the Bayesian network. The system has been applied to the production line of a chipset factory and the results show that the system can support decision making for fault diagnosis promptly and correctly.},

However, the recent increase of dimensionality of data poses a severe challenge to many existing feature selection methods with respect to efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we introduce a novel concept, predominant correlation, and propose a fast filter method which can identify relevant features as well as redundancy among relevant features without pairwise correlation analysis. The efficiency and effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive comparisons with other methods using real-world data of high dimensionality.",

The Netview software allows knowledge engineers to dynamically view subnetworks for knowledge engineering, and it provides version control for editing a BN. Netview generates sub-networks in which leak probabilities are dynamically updated to reflect the missing portions of the network.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic graphical models and decision graphs are powerful modeling tools for reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. As modeling languages they allow a natural specification of problem domains with inherent uncertainty, and from a computational perspective they support efficient algorithms for automatic construction and query answering. This includes belief updating, finding the most probable explanation for the observed evidence, detecting conflicts in the evidence entered into the network, determining optimal strategies, analyzing for relevance, and performing sensitivity analysis. The book introduces probabilistic graphical models and decision graphs, including Bayesian networks and influence diagrams. The reader is introduced to the two types of frameworks through examples and exercises, which also instruct the reader on how to build these models.  The book is a new edition of Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs by Finn V. Jensen. The new edition is structured into two parts. The first part focuses on probabilistic graphical models. Compared with the previous book, the new edition also includes a thorough description of recent extensions to the Bayesian network modeling language, advances in exact and approximate belief updating algorithms, and methods for learning both the structure and the parameters of a Bayesian network. The second part deals with decision graphs, and in addition to the frameworks described in the previous edition, it also introduces Markov decision processes and partially ordered decision problems. The authors also      provide a well-founded practical introduction to Bayesian networks, object-oriented Bayesian networks, decision trees, influence diagrams (and variants hereof), and Markov decision processes.   give practical advice on the construction of Bayesian networks, decision trees, and influence diagrams from domain knowledge.  give several examples and exercises exploiting computer systems for dealing with Bayesian networks and decision graphs.   present a thorough introduction to state-of-the-art solution and analysis algorithms.   The book is intended as a textbook, but it can also be used for self-study and as a reference book.},
