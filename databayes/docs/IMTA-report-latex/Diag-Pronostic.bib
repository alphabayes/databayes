	abstract = {Given key performance indicators collected with ﬁne granularity as time series, our aim is to predict and explain failures in storage environments. Although explainable predictive modeling based on spiky telemetry data is key in many domains, current approaches cannot tackle this problem. Deep learning methods suitable for sequence modeling and learning temporal dependencies, such as RNNs, are effective, but opaque from an explainability perspective. Our approach ﬁrst extracts the anomalous spikes from time series as events and then builds an RNN classiﬁer with attention mechanisms to embed the irregularity and frequency of these events. A preliminary evaluation on real world storage environments shows that our approach can predict failures within a 3-day prediction window with comparable accuracy as traditional RNN-based classiﬁers. At the same time it can explain the predictions by returning the key anomalous events which led to those failure predictions.},

The investigation of the human diagnostic reasoning process has resulted in the abstraction and capturing of the human ability to learn, understand, and diagnose different machinery belonging to a particular class. The captured abstraction of human diagnostic expertise have been integrated with the expert system development expertise of knowledge engineers to provide a customized expert system shell for developing machine fault diagnosis expert systems. The designed machine fault diagnosis shell reduces the development time, effort and skill making use of generalized modules for knowledge acquisition, knowledge verification, application system generation, learning, explanation, and eliminates the burden of designing and developing each application diagnosis expert system separately. The developed shell has been validated by generating a prototype fault diagnosis expert system for a Cincinnati Milacron 786 robot.},

	abstract = {Fault diagnostics are increasingly important for ensuring vehicle safety and reliability. One of the issues in vehicle fault diagnosis is the difficulty of successful interpretation of failure symptoms to correctly diagnose the real root cause. This paper presents an innovative Bayesian Network based method for guiding off-line vehicle fault diagnosis. By using a vehicle infotainment system as a case study, a number of Bayesian diagnostic models have been established for fault cases with single and multiple symptoms. Particular considerations are given to the design of the Bayesian model structure, determination of prior probabilities of root causes, and diagnostic procedure. In order to unburden the computation, an object oriented model structure has been adopted to prevent the model from overly large. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of guiding vehicle diagnostics in a probabilistic manner. Furthermore, the method features a multiple-symptoms-orientated troubleshooting strategy, and is capable of diagnosing multiple symptoms optimally and simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Fault diagnosis is an area of great concern of any industry to reduce maintenance cost and increase profitability in the mean time. But most of the researches tend to rely on sensor data and equipment structure, which are expensive because each category of equipment differs from the others. Thus developing a universal system remains a key challenge to be solved. A universal expert system is developed in this paper making full use of expertspsila knowledge to diagnose the possible root causes and the corresponding probabilities for maintenance decision making support. Bayesian network was chosen as the inference engine of the system through raw data analysis. Improved causal relationship questionnaire and probability scale method were applied to construct the Bayesian network. The system has been applied to the production line of a chipset factory and the results show that the system can support decision making for fault diagnosis promptly and correctly.},
